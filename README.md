minecraft one block command generator...in javascript

This gives you a convenient editor that can create so called 'one command block' creations: you place down one command block, paste in an enormous command script, and let the code do the rest.

Heavliy inspired by the methods used by TheRedEngineer (http://www.theredengineer.com) to easily create these scripts. Note that this only supports Minecraft 1.12.2 command syntax, other versions in the works.
